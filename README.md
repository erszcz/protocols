# Protocols

This project is a sandbox to try out various serialisation protocols and
toolchains and evaluate the level of support available on the BEAM.


## JSON Type Definition

[JSON Type Definition](https://jsontypedef.com/) is an alternative for JSON Schema
optimised for code generation. It's formally described by
[RFC 8927](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8927).
There are validator and code generator implementations available for
multiple languages, including Elixir (unofficial library tested in this project) and C#.
